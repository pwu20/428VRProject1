Project 1 for CS 428: Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality At UIC Fall 2020


******KNOWN ISSUES******

- If you're using arrow keys to cycle through all of the 9 conditions, audio may not play when object loads. This can be fixed by refinding target image however.

- Sometimes take a while to find Mars image. Swtiching From Datebase to From Image helped but still can be finicky
